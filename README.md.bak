# SuperMemoVim: The keyboard SuperMemo experience

You need AutoHotkey for this. Double click SuperMemoVim.ahk, and you shall see a new icon popping up on your taskbar.

Disclaimer: I have been simultaneously developing and using this script for 1.5 months. Nothing happened to my collection so far, but I can't guarantee it won't happen in the future. Please make sure you have proper backup strategy in place.

# Modes

You can see which mode you are in via the icon in your taskbar.

## Normal mode

For navigating. Press `ctrl` or `esc` to return to normal mode in **all** other modes.

## Insert mode

For text editing. Press `shift` in **all** modes to enter insert mode, and press `i` to enter insert mode in **normal** or **visual** mode.

## Visual mode

For selecting text and editing selected text. Press `v` in **normal** mode to enter visual mode.

## Command mode

For longer scripts. In **normal** mode, press `;` or `:` to enter command mode, press it again to return to normal mode.

## Additional hotkeys

Caveat: ctrl+m is remapped to `ctrl+shift+alt+m`, and ctrl+shift+j is remapped to `ctrl+shift+alt+j`.

In Plan window: `alt+a`: insert accident activity
`ctrl+alt+s`: go to source (works differently for element window / browser)

`ctrl+alt+k`: more intuitive inter-element linking, inspired by obsidian
first you need to go to the element you want to link to, and press ctrl+alt+shift+k
and go to the element you want to have the hyperlink, select text and press ctrl+alt+k
