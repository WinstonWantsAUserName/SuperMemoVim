; Text after a semicolon are treated as comments and ignored.
; The test will be sent as written from normal mode, with the cursor at the start of the sample text.
; Use {esc} to send an escape key, and {return} to send a newline.
; Otherwise it is best to avoid {} characters.
; Please put a comment at the end of your test case stating what it tests.
;
; Sample text (reference only, see testscript for actual text):
;
;This is the first line of the test, and contains a comma and a period.
;Second line here
;3rd line. The second line is shorter than both 1st and 3rd line.
;The fourth line contains     some additional whitespace.
;What should I put on the 5th line?A missing space, perhaps
;This line 6 should be longer than the line before it and after it to test kj
;No line, including 7, can be longer than 80 characters.
;This is because onenote wraps automatically, (line 8)
;And treats a wrapped line as separate lines (line 9)
;
; First sample line is actually blank. Tests no input/metatest.
